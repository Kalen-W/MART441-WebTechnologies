Write a 1/2 page paper on your experience. How does node.js fit into everything that we have done this semester?

---

Node.js was a bit difficult for me to wrap my head around, and honestly I still don't completely understand how what I'm submitting works, I just had to copy from the given example. Though I've always just been a slow learner, so it's likely that this was simply too much information for me to really absorb in one week.

As for node.js itself, while all we really learned was the basics of setting up a server and how to write and read text, I can certainly see how node.js would allow for much more complex websites and applications. And I believe how node.js fits into everything else we’ve done this semester is that it’s a transition away from more static websites into something more dynamic. I’d say some simpler applications of node.js seem to be similar to how cookies and local storage can be used, with the exception that the data is being saved to the server rather than the client. And although we didn’t delve too much into node.js, I’m sure the ability to save data to the server has far more complex use cases than cookies and local storage. I'm also sure node.js likely allows for far more complex things than simply creating text files on the server, which, again, seems to be a transition into more dynamic websites.
