I probably struggled with this assignment far more than I should have. So, with the previous web design course I took, I feel I never really came to any understanding on how to create a responsive website. I understand breakpoints and such, I just sill don't understand how best to actually use them. I'm also just very rusty with HTML and web design stuff, as I don't enjoy it all that much, and thus haven't practiced it any since the last web design course I took about a year ago. I also don't feel like I've ever learned about how to actually make a web site visually appealing past the very basic principles of white space, so I have no idea what I'm doing on that front. Anyways, although I can't say I'm terribly happy with the end result, it's the best I could do after about a day and a half of work.
