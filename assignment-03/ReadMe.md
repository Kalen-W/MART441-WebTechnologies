I spent quite a lot of time on this assignment, but, that time mostly went into making the animated background. I spent a lot of time tweaking values and figuring out how to get smoother looking random movement (eventually going with a small random chance to adjust the object's direction by some amount). The end result isn't particularly impressive or anything, but I'm still happy with it.

I also spent some time figuring out how to create and remove elements rather than just changing their properties, so that I could easily change the number of buttons or paragraphs. Though honestly the biggest difficult I had with this was initially forgetting I needed to reference my script file within the body for it to be capable of referencing the body.

Lastly, I'm not particularly happy with how I actually have the buttons and paragraphs change, as, if you look at my code, it relies on a long switch statement to function. I spent quite a bit of time trying to make something that didn't require this sort of manual set up, where the buttons created had all the necessary info passed into the called function, but I couldn't get it to work unfortunately.
